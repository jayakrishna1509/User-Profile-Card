4. Event Handling:
a. Add a button in App that toggles the visibility of the user card when clicked.

5. Conditional Rendering:

6. Styling:

## 🌐 Sample Output:

[Hide Profile Button]

• When the "Hide Profile" button is clicked, the card should disappear, and the button text should change to 
"Show Profile".

## ✨ Bonus (Optional):
• Animate the show/hide of the card (e.g., simple fade or slide animation).

• Make the component responsive for mobile and desktop.
